# PerimeterX Solver
PerimeterX - Handicapped

The [source](source) is the original code, and the [readable](readable) has the specific steps to de-obfuscate the original code.

Looks like PerimeterX obfuscation is fairly simple and there are no special checks, just the most common collection of fingerprints.

PX's script obfuscation method is very, very, very simple, 100x simpler than reCAPTCHA / 10x simpler than Akamai / 1,000x simpler than Shape!!!! So in the future, writing automated deobfuscation programs is possible!
